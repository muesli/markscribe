## Template Engine

markscribe uses Go's powerful template engine. You can find its documentation
here: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/

## Template Helpers

markscribe comes with a few handy template helpers:

To format timestamps, call `humanize`:

```
{{humanize .Timestamp}}
```

To reverse the order of a slice, call `reverse`:

```
{{reverse (rss "https://domain.tld/feed.xml" 5)}}
```

## GitHub Authentication

In order to access some of GitHub's API, markscribe requires you to provide a
valid GitHub token in an environment variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN`. You can
create a new token by going to your profile settings:

`Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Generate new token`

## GoodReads API key

In order to access some of GoodReads' API, markscribe requires you to provide a
valid GoodReads key in an environment variable called `GOODREADS_TOKEN`. You can
create a new token by going [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys).
Then you need to go to your repository and add it, `Settings -> Secrets -> New secret`.
You also need to set your GoodReads user ID in your secrets as `GOODREADS_USER_ID`.
